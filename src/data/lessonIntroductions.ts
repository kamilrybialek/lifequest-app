  // BABY STEP 1: $1,000 Emergency Fund
  // ============================================

  'step1-lesson1': {
    title: 'Why You Need $1,000 NOW',
    problem: 'Life is unpredictable. Your car breaks down, the washing machine stops working, or you need an urgent dentist visit. Without a financial cushion, every unexpected situation means credit card debt.',
    impact: 'The average household faces 2-3 unexpected expenses per year ranging from $200-800 each. Without an emergency fund, each situation becomes new debt.',
    solution: '$1,000 is your first line of defense. This isn\'t an investment - it\'s your peace of mind. This money stands between you and credit card debt.',
    action: 'In this lesson, you\'ll learn why an emergency fund is the FIRST step to financial freedom - even before paying off debt.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Emergency fund = no panic when unexpected expenses hit',
      'Protects you from new debt',
      'Psychological boost - see progress in 30-90 days',
    ],
    timeEstimate: 5,
  },

  'step1-lesson2': {
    title: 'How to Find Your First $500 in 30 Days',
    problem: 'You think: "I don\'t have money to save." But the truth is, most of us spend more than we think on things that aren\'t priorities.',
    impact: 'Studies show the average person spends $100-200 per month on "small pleasures" - coffee, subscriptions, takeout food.',
    solution: 'You don\'t need to cut spending forever. You need to "take a sharp turn" for 30-60 days. Temporary sacrifice for long-term security.',
    action: 'You\'ll learn specific strategies to find your first $500 without drastically lowering your quality of life.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Audit your spending from the last 30 days',
      'Temporarily cancel subscriptions',
      'Meal prep instead of takeout = $80-160 saved',
      'Sell unused items = quick $120-320',
    ],
    timeEstimate: 10,
  },

  'step1-lesson3': {
    title: 'Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund',
    problem: 'Many people save money in the same account as their everyday spending. Result? The fund "mysteriously disappears" on other things.',
    impact: 'If your fund is easily accessible, the likelihood of spending it on non-emergencies increases by 70%.',
    solution: 'Your emergency fund must be: (1) separated from daily accounts, (2) easily accessible in a real emergency, (3) NOT invested in stocks/funds.',
    action: 'You\'ll learn where to keep this money and how to avoid the temptation to spend it.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Separate savings account (preferably different bank)',
      'No debit card linked to this account',
      'NOT long-term deposits - you need 24h access',
      'Psychological barrier = less temptation',
    ],
    timeEstimate: 5,
  },

  'step1-lesson4': {
    title: 'Practice: First $100 in 7 Days',
    problem: 'Theory is one thing, but without a concrete action plan, nothing will happen.',
    impact: 'People who have a written savings plan save 3x more than those without one.',
    solution: 'Micro-challenge: $100 in 7 days. This is an achievable goal that builds momentum.',
    action: 'This is a practical lesson - you\'ll leave with concrete tasks for the next 7 days.',

  // BABY STEP 2: Debt Snowball
  // ============================================

  'step2-lesson1': {
    title: 'Why Snowball, Not Avalanche?',
    problem: 'Most financial experts will tell you: "Pay off highest interest debt first" (avalanche method). Mathematically, they\'re right. Psychologically - it\'s a disaster.',
    impact: 'The avalanche method saves an average of 5-15% in interest. But 70% of people quit after 3-6 months because they don\'t see progress.',
    solution: 'Snowball method: pay off smallest debt first. This is NOT about math - it\'s about psychology. Quick wins = motivation = long-term success.',
    action: 'You\'ll understand why small psychological wins > interest savings.',
    keyPoints: [
      'First debt paid in 30-90 days = psychological boost',
      'Momentum > math in the long run',
      'Dave Ramsey helped millions pay off debt with this method',
      'Behavior change > interest rate optimization',

      'This is your roadmap',
      'Truth is less scary than uncertainty',
    ],
    timeEstimate: 15,

  'step2-lesson3': {
    title: 'Attack Plan: Intensity vs. Time',
    problem: 'People ask: "How long will this take?" Answer: it depends on your intensity.',
    impact: 'Minimum payments = decades of repayment. Intense repayment = freedom in 18-36 months.',
    solution: 'This isn\'t a marathon - it\'s a sprint. The more intensely you attack debt, the faster you regain freedom.',
    action: 'You\'ll learn how to find EVERY extra dollar and throw it at your smallest debt.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Minimum payments on all debts EXCEPT the smallest',

  // ============================================

  'step3-lesson1': {
    title: 'From $1,000 to 6 Months of Expenses',
    problem: '$1,000 protects you from small emergencies. But what if you lose your job? Serious illness? Major disaster?',
    impact: 'The average person needs 3-5 months to find a new job. Without a proper emergency fund, you\'re back in debt.',
    solution: 'Full emergency fund = 3-6 months of EXPENSES (not income!). This is your true financial freedom.',

    keyPoints: [
      'Calculate monthly expenses (not income!)',

    title: 'How Many Months? 3 vs 6 vs 12',
    problem: 'Do you need 3, 6, or maybe 12 months of expenses? It depends.',
    impact: 'Too small fund = risk. Too large = money not working for you.',
    solution: 'Decision matrix based on your situation: job stability, number of income earners, health.',
    action: 'You\'ll determine your ideal number of months.',
    keyPoints: [
      '3 months = stable job, double income, young',
      '6 months = standard safety net',
      '9-12 months = self-employed, single income, children',
      'Your situation = your number',
    ],
    timeEstimate: 10,
  },

  'step3-lesson3': {
    title: 'Common Mistakes: What\'s NOT an Emergency',
    problem: 'People spend their emergency fund on "emergencies" like: sales, holidays, vacations.',
    impact: '60% of people with an emergency fund spend it on non-emergencies within the first year.',
    solution: 'Clear definition: emergency = unexpected, necessary, urgent. Everything else = NOT emergency.',
    action: 'You\'ll learn strict guidelines on when you can (and CAN\'T) use this fund.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Emergency: job loss, car repair, urgent medical visit',

    timeEstimate: 5,

  'step3-lesson4': {
    title: 'Congratulations! Now You Can Build Wealth',
