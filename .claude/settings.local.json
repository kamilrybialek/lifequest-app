      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfix: Complete XP/level/streak system implementation\n\nDatabase Layer (user.ts):\n- Add updateStreak() - properly calculates daily streaks with day difference logic\n- Add getDailyProgress() - counts completed tasks per pillar today\n- Add getAllStreaks() - returns current streaks for all 4 pillars\n- Fix addXP() to use consistent level calculation (XP / 100 + 1)\n\nRandom Tasks Integration (randomTasks.ts):\n- Import addXP and updateStreak from user.ts\n- Update completeRandomActionTask() to call both functions\n- Log comprehensive activity data (XP, level, streak changes)\n- Add console logging for task completion feedback\n\nAppStore Integration (appStore.ts):\n- Import getUserStats, getAllStreaks, getDailyProgress\n- Modify loadAppData() to load from SQLite instead of just AsyncStorage\n- Fetch real-time XP, level, and streak data from database\n- Properly integrate with authStore to get userId\n- Fall back gracefully if no user is logged in\n\nStreak Logic:\n- Same day: don''t increment (prevent spam)\n- Next day (diff = 1): increment streak\n- Missed days (diff > 1): reset to 1\n- Update last_active_date on each completion\n\nXP & Level Calculation:\n- Consistent formula: level = floor(total_xp / 100) + 1\n- Level 1: 0-99 XP\n- Level 2: 100-199 XP\n- Level 3: 200-299 XP, etc.\n\nThis fixes the broken progression system where XP/levels/streaks weren''t updating.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
