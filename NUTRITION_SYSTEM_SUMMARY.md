## Overview
Created a comprehensive nutrition journey system matching the Finance, Mental, and Physical pillar structures with integrated tools, lesson paths, and database for meal planning and tracking.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. **Nutrition Types** (`src/types/nutrition.ts`)

**Foundations:**

5. Sugar & Processed Foods (hidden sugars, ultra-processed, swaps)
6. Timing & Meal Frequency (circadian eating, IF, workout nutrition)
7. Special Diets & Approaches (Mediterranean, plant-based, keto, personalization)
8. Sustainable Habits & Mindset (80/20 rule, mindful eating, social eating)

**6 Integrated Tools:**
- Meal Logger (üçΩÔ∏è)
- Calorie Counter (üî•)
- Meal Planner (üìã)
- Diet Planner (ü•ó)
- Water Tracker (üíß)
- Macro Tracker (üìä)

## üöÄ Next Steps (Ready to Implement)

### 3. **Database Queries** (`src/database/nutrition.ts` - TO CREATE)

```typescript
// Core functions needed:
- getNutritionProgress(userId)
- updateNutritionProgress(userId, data)
- logMeal(userId, mealData, foodItems[])
- getMeals(userId, startDate, endDate)
- getDailyNutritionSummary(userId, date)
- addFoodItem(foodData)
- searchFoodItems(query)
- createMealPlan(userId, planData)
- getMealPlans(userId)
- addPlannedMeal(mealPlanId, mealData)
- createRecipe(userId, recipeData, ingredients[])
- getRecipes(userId, filters)
- logWaterIntake(userId, amountMl, date)
- getWaterIntake(userId, date)
- setMacroGoals(userId, goals)
- getMacroGoals(userId)
```

### 4. **NutritionPath Screen** (TO CREATE)

**File:** `src/screens/nutrition/NutritionPath.tsx`

**Structure (based on PhysicalHealthPath.tsx):**
- Header with nutrition journey title
- Tools section (6 tools in grid)
- Next lesson card (if available)
- Path divider
- Collapsible foundations with lessons
- Progress tracking

**Key Features:**
- Load progress from database
- Auto-expand current foundation
- Lock/unlock lessons based on completion
- Navigate to lesson content screens
- Navigate to tool screens

### 5. **Tool Screens** (TO CREATE)

Each tool needs its own screen:

1. **MealLogger** - Log meals with food search, portion sizes, photos
2. **CalorieCounter** - Track daily calories with progress bars
3. **MealPlanner** - Weekly meal planning calendar
4. **DietPlanner** - Create custom diet plans with macro targets
5. **WaterTracker** - Track daily water intake with visual progress
6. **MacroTracker** - Monitor protein/carbs/fats with pie charts

### 6. **Admin Panel Integration**

**Add to admin panel (`admin-panel/index.html`):**
- Food Items Management (CRUD)
- Recipe Management
- Meal Plan Templates
- View user nutrition progress
- Analytics (most logged foods, popular recipes)

**API Endpoints needed** (`admin-api/server.js`):
```
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/food-items
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/recipes
GET /api/admin/nutrition-stats
POST /api/admin/meal-plan-templates
```

## üéØ Future AI Integration Points

1. **AI Meal Planner:**
   - Generate personalized meal plans based on:
     - User goals (weight loss/muscle gain/maintenance)
     - Dietary preferences/restrictions
     - Budget
     - Time availability for cooking
   - Flag: `is_ai_generated` in `meal_plans` table

2. **Food Recognition:**
   - Photo-based food logging using vision AI
   - Barcode scanning for packaged foods
   - Store in `food_items` with `barcode` field

3. **Smart Recommendations:**
   - Suggest foods to hit macro goals
   - Recommend recipes based on available ingredients
   - Meal timing optimization
